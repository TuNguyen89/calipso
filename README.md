# CALIPSO

This repository hosts and links to the open source contributions to the Contiki OS in the context of the CALIPSO project (http://www.ict-calipso.eu/).
Each contribution has its own top-level directory, containing a README.md file that contains specific information about authorship, affiliations, relation to CALIPSO and Contiki, etc.
The source code may either be directly included in the directory, or a link to an external directory may be provided.
